zGlue ZIP OrCAD Design Example
******************************

Author(s): Jorge Rojas

Description
===========

This repository contains an example OrCAD project of a valid ZIP design, which can be imported into ChipBuilder. It contains the SPICE netlist and ZEF Netlist Constraints files that describe the system, together with a TCL script that generated them. Also, there's an OrCAD library with the SmartFabric schematic symbols used in the design. For a complete specification of the SmartFabric symbols, and the SPICE netlist and netlist constraint format, please visit the `ZEF Netlist Constraint GitHub repository <https://github.com/zglue/zef-netlist-constraintÂ >`_.
