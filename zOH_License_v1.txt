zGlue Open Hardware LicenseVersion 1.0, June 10, 2019Copyright 2020 zGlue Inc. <https://zglue.com>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.PreambleThe zGlue Open Hardware (zOH) License is a free, CERN-OHL based license related to selecting, building, and optimizing custom chips using ChipBuilderô by zGlue Inc. and available at chipbuilder.zglue.com.  While the CERN-OHL license is an open source hardware license, the scope of zOHL also covers software (e.g., open source code) needed for the hardware design using ChipBuilderô.  zOH License is adapted from the CERN-OHL license version 2.0.  CERN developed a license to promote collaboration among hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs.  Use of the zOH License does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.zOH License allows anyone using ChipBuilderô to apply specific design information (e.g., netlist, firmware, bill-of-material (BOM), etc.) to design, code, and make custom chip(s), and to maximize their chip features by programming integrated peripherals in Smart Fabricô by zGlue Inc.  Users of the zOH License can select, build, and optimize their custom chips by selecting chiplets from zGlue’s ChipletStore, construct schematics and connect to embedded peripherals, and choose from diverse chip package options with support for LGA packages.  Users of the zOH License can maximize efficiency with zGlue Smart Fabricô API (Application Specific Interface) and minimize errors by using control Smart Fabricô functions through programming, reprogramming their chips on the fly, and download and use zGlue software development kit (SDK) and APIs.  However, the zOH License does not permit anyone without prior authorization from zGlue Inc. and separate available license from zGlue Inc., to build, develop, and/or modify their own Smart Fabricô substrates.  As such, the scope of the zOH License excludes the development and/or modifications to the Smart Fabricô substrate owned by zGlue Inc.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and using of various features of ChipBuilderô associated with the zOH License follow.TERMS AND CONDITIONS1	Definitions1.1.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section 6, or where terminated by the Licensor for cause) patent license to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as Conveyed by that Licensor.7.2.	If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You under this License is invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted to You under this License shall terminate as of the date such process is initiated.8	General8.1.	If any provisions of this License are or subsequently become invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain effective.8.2.	You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor is known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where the use is otherwise allowed by law.  Any such permitted use shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or its personnel.8.3.	zGlue Inc. may publish updated versions and variants of this License which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  New versions will be published with a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant.  If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source as being released under any version of the zOH License with that variant.  If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated as being released under zOH License V. 1.0.  The Licensor may also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the zOH License or any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version of zOH License with the same variant identifier published by zGlue Inc.8.4.	This License shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail to comply with any of its terms and conditions.8.5.	However, if You cease all breaches of this License, then Your License from any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has terminated this License by giving You, while You remain in breach, a notice specifying the breach and requiring You to cure it within 30 days, and You have failed to come into compliance in all material respects by the end of the 30 day period. Should You repeat the breach after receipt of a cure notice and subsequent reinstatement, this License will terminate immediately and permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply after any termination.8.6.	This License shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.9	No Surrender of Others' Freedom.9.1.	If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONSzOH License v. 1.0Page 1 of 1
